I build algorithms to better understand network traffic, often in the context
of improving security, ascertaining ownership of digital assets, or identifying
abuse on the Internet. While completing my Ph.D. at [Georgia
Tech](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/), I published [academic
papers](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WLiTyjsAAAAJ) in these or
nearby spaces and also have written in [less](../posts)
[formal](https://corelight.blog/author/yacin-nadji/)
[venues](https://iisp.gatech.edu/cybersecurity-news-commentary-january-2017).
When I find something particularly cool, I give
[workshops](https://forum.defcon.org/node/228551) and [online training
courses](https://learning.oreilly.com/live-training/courses/hands-on-adversarial-machine-learning/0636920285342/).
I'm happy to review [technical
material](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/strengthening-deep-neural/9781492044949/),
too.

I'm an advocate for fully-remote work and am curious about how to improve the
remote experience from a management perspective. By day, I work as a Senior
Security Researcher at [Corelight
Labs](https://corelight.com/company/corelight-labs/mission-team). I volunteer
as a Tech Instructor for [Black Girls Code](http://www.blackgirlscode.com/) and
am interested in other similar volunteer roles.

Foolhardily unleashed on this world by my American and Algerian-now-American
parents, I was born and raised in middle-of-nowhere Michigan and ended up in DC
by way of Chicago and Atlanta. I'm also a cassette tape enthusiast, relentless
city biker, bad soccer player, mediocre gardener, and [Daria
superfan](https://www.instagram.com/dariascreens/).
