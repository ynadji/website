I like to build algorithms to better understand network traffic, often in the
context of improving security, ascertaining ownership of digital assets, or
identifying abuse on the Internet. I've published some of this work as [academic
papers](shit) {{ $Site.BaseURL }} or used what I've learned to provide analyses
in [less](../posts) formal
[venues](https://iisp.gatech.edu/cybersecurity-news-commentary-january-2017).
When I've found something particularly cool, I try to give
[workshops](https://forum.defcon.org/node/228551) and [online training
courses](https://learning.oreilly.com/live-training/courses/hands-on-adversarial-machine-learning/0636920285342/).

I'm a fervent advocate for fully-remote work and am curious about how to improve
the remote experience from a management perspective. During typical human work
hours, I'm a security researcher at [Corelight](https://corelight.com/). I also
occasionally volunteer as a Tech Instructor for [Black Girls
Code](http://www.blackgirlscode.com/) and am interested in other similar
volunteer roles.

Foolhardily unleashed on this world by my American and Algerian-now-American
parents, I was born and raised in middle-of-nowhere Michigan and ended up in DC
by way of Chicago and Atlanta (AKA Stankonia). I'm also a cassette tape
enthusiast, relentless city biker, bad soccer player, muay thai trainee, [Daria
superfan](https://www.instagram.com/dariascreens/), and proud
[Ex-Muslim](https://exmuslims.org/ex-muslims-of-north-america-debuts-billboards-in-atlanta-chicago-houston/).
