		<h1>Fall 2016: ECE 8813/CS 8803 Advanced Computer Security</h1>
		<h2>Summary</h2>
		<p>This course is designed to introduce students to
		  seminal and cutting-edge work in network/system
		  security to prepare them to make research
		  contributions. Students will learn to read, present
		  and critique technical papers and design, develop,
		  and deploy a medium-sized team project.</p>

		<h2>Grading/Expectations</h2>
		<p>Grades are almost entirely based on the final
		  project, which is further broken down into five
		  components. Each deliverable will be explained in
		  detail below. Grading is subject to minor
		  changes.</p>
		<ul>
		  <li>Project: 70%</li>
		  <ul>
		    <li>Project plan: 5%</li>
		    <li>Project progress reports: 10%</li>
		    <li>Code: 30%</li>
		    <li>Final presentation: 20%</li>
		    <li>Final report: 35%</li>
		  </ul>
		  <li>Paper presentation: 20% (5% for extra presentations)</li>
		  <li>Reading responses: 10%</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Letter grades are given according to the following
		  cutoffs with no rounding:</p>
		<ul>
		  <li>90.0 <= A <= 100</li>
		  <li>80.0 <= B < 90.0</li>
		  <li>70.0 <= C < 80.0</li>
		  <li>60.0 <= D < 70.0</li>
		  <li>0 <= F < 60.0</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Project</h3>
		<p>Each student is responsible for a final group
		  project. Sample project ideas will be presented in
		  class on August 24, but students may propose their
		  own projects. Ultimately, projects must be approved
		  by me. Students are responsible for forming their
		  own teams of between three and five
		  members. Projects may be written in any language,
		  but some project descriptions may have a suggested
		  language and/or toolkit where appropriate. Projects
		  are designed to potentially be publishable in
		  security workshops or conferences. Virtual machines
		  will be made available to students that need access
		  to sensitive data or simply need computing
		  resources.</p>
		<h4>Project plan (5% of project grade)</h4>
		<p>A two page document describing your team, your
		  proposed approach, your intended deliverables, and a
		  timeline for your deliverables. We will revisit this
		  timeline when progress reports are given. I
		  encourage teams to update their project plan
		  throughout the semester. Not only can this be used
		  to get additional feedback from myself, it will help
		  when writing your final report.</p>
		<h4>Project progress reports (10% of project grade)</h4>
		<p>Periodically throughout the semester, each team
		  will give a short, five minute status report to
		  ensure the team is on track and identify any
		  problems or help that you may need. Slides are not
		  mandatory, but are allowed if the team believes they
		  will be helpful.</p>
		<h4>Code (30% of project grade)</h4>
		<p><em>"We reject kings, presidents and voting. We
		believe in rough consensus and running code."</em>
		-- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_D._Clark">Dave
		Clark</a></p>
		<p>Despite this being academia, I care about systems
		  that work.  ALL code should be stored in GT's GitHub
		  in
		  the <a href="https://github.gatech.edu/organizations/AdvancedComputerSecurity2016">organization
		  for this class</a>. You must login
		  to <a href="https://github.gatech.edu/">GT's
		  GitHub</a> before I can add you to the organization.
		  Version control is a necessity. I would recommend
		  using GitHub's Issues for tracking bugs and
		  assigning work. ALL projects must contain a
		  README.md that clearly explains how to install and
		  run your code.</p>
		<p>Extra credit will be given for:</p>
		<ul>
		  <li>Including tests (more points for higher code coverage).</li>
		  <li>Deploying your project in <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a>.</li>
		  <li>Using your language's dependency manager.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Code that doesn't run, compile, or work properly
		  will not be given a good grade. Do not wait to start
		  designing and implementing your final project.</p>
		<h4>Final presentation (20% of project grade)</h4>
		<p>Each team will be responsible for a 15 minute
		  presentation describing their project's motivation,
		  the team's solution, implementation details, and the
		  results their project generated. Presentations
		  should include potential avenues for future
		  work.</p>
		<h4>Final report (35% of project grade)</h4>
		<p>Research results only matter if they are
		  effectively communicated to the community at
		  large. The final report should follow the format
		  (LaTeX preferred, Word allowed), structure and style
		  of a top-tier conference paper in security. Reports
		  must also include a section summarizing the
		  contribution of each group member. GitHub commit
		  history will be cross-referenced. I recommend
		  students contribute material to the final report
		  throughout the semester. If you use LaTeX, working
		  together through version control will be a piece of
		  cake! Proofread your papers please. Unreadable
		  content will be penalized.</p>
		<h3>Paper presentation</h3>
		<p>Students will present at least one paper during the
		  regular session. The purpose of this component is to
		  train students how to read and understand a
		  technical document well enough to convey the
		  material to others and simply practice presenting
		  technical work. Students must create the slides
		  themselves, even if the paper has been presented and
		  the slides are publicly available. Content from the
		  paper or presentations may be used <em>as long as
		  they are properly sourced</em>. We do not steal
		  content.</p>
		<p>If the class size remains at ~40, presentations
		  will be done in pairs. Students will pick their own
		  partners, but you may contact me if you are having a
		  hard time finding a partner. Additional
		  presentations may be done for extra credit, but only
		  after everyone has presented at least once.</p>
		<p>A Google spreadsheet will be made for students to
		  sign up to present papers when the reading list has
		  been finalized.</p>
		<h3>Reading responses</h3>
		<p>Students are responsible for reading all of the
		  papers so they are prepared to discuss them in
		  class. To ensure you have something to contribute,
		  each student must submit a <em>hardcopy</em> summary
		  and response for each paper at the beginning of
		  every class. One paragraph for the summary and one
		  paragraph for your response to the paper (strengths,
		  weaknesses, questions).</p>
		<h3>Honor Code</h3>
		<p>All students must follow the academic integrity and <a href="http://policylibrary.gatech.edu/student-affairs/academic-honor-code">Georgia Tech Honor Code</a>.</p>
